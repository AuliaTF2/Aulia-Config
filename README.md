# Version
version: 2.4.2
deleted threading setting entirely from comanglia config
since it's unstable and cause some crash and potentially
reduce performance, changed the rate to 655,360 (5.0mbps) to suit
most people that have garbage internet like me, reduced gib parts
and added mouse cvars from mastercoms flat-mouse addon
